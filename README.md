## How to install

```
This web application comes with a built in initializer for you home database. 
There will not be a release, so if you were given access to download, contribute, 
and so on you will need to change your home connection string to whatever your home db is. 
Keep in mind due to the virus each of ran a local db.
Once you setup your connection string, just run the program(F5) and your database will be 
built for you using the admin setup below.

User Name: admin@gmail.com
Password: Admin123*

Your database will be empty, but it will have the correct format. 
After you log in with the admin you can add, edit, delete and so on.
